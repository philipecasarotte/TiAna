has_permalink
=============

Instalation
-----------

1) Install the plugin with `script/plugin install git://github.com/fnando/has_permalink.git`
2) Install the unicode gem with `sudo gem install unicode`

Usage
=====
1) Add the method call `has_permalink` to your model. Your model should have a 'permalink' attribute.

class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_permalink :title
end

You can specify the permalink field:

class page < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_permalink :title => :title_permalink
end

If you don't want to use has_permalink, you can call 'some text'.to_permalink string method.

NOTE: Permalinks are not unique. Remember to override to_param method as follow:

def to_param
  "#{id}-#{permalink}"
end

By overriding to_param method you don't have to change a thing on your app routes. ;)

The permalink is created when after_validation callback is evaluated. This plugin also tries
to generate a permalink when before_save callback is evaluated and the instance has no permalink set.
